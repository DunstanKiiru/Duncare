## Introduction

Duncare is a full-stack web application designed to help veterinary clinics manage pet care services efficiently. It provides a comprehensive platform to manage pet owners, pets, clinic staff, appointments, treatments, medications, and billing â€” all in one place. The backend is built with Flask, providing a RESTful API, while the frontend is developed using React for a responsive and dynamic user experience.
